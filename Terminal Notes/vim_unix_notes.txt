Note from Vim/Unix Workshop

scp your_username@remotehost.edu:foobar.txt/some/local/directory (this copies from ssh server to local computer

scp filename host@name: ~

~ refers to current directory


.. parent directory of current working directory

touch: creates an empty file

rm -r: lets you delete a directory and asks if you want to delete a file in that directoy

rm -rf: forces the deleting so you are not prompted for each file

cat: prints out contents of file

echo: like a print function (echo by default prints a new line by default) (-n: removes new line)

mv: moves a file (can also rename a file/folder)

cp: copying a file (makes a new file that is copy of the original file)

less: examine a file with scrolling

>: write to a file
>>: append to file
(These are called redirection operators) i.e. cat file.txt > new_file.txt

man [command name]: takes you to manual for that command and explains it 

grep <string> file: find a string in a file

find <dir> -name <file>: finds a file in a directory with that name. make sure -name flag is included.

|: piping, connect stdout to stdin
	ie find .| grep ( the . lets you print all possible paths/files in that directory)

&: run in background

curl/wget: downloads a webpage

*: wildcard command 

`: back tick for cat `find . -name thing`

$: takes stdout to cat (i.e. cat $(things))

UNIX Permissions

ls -l: list files and their permissions

chmod ### filename sets permissions for that file
	can also do chmod +x, +r, +w changes execute, read, write permissions respectively. (Can this remove them?)
	Wikipedia for permission chart, but here is a simply copy
	
#	Permission					rwx
7	read, write and execute		111
6	read and write				110
5	read and execute			101
4	read only					100
3	write and execute			011
2	write only					010
1	execute only				001
0	none						000
